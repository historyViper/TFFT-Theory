# Temporal Flow Field Theory (TFFT)

**A reformulation of gravity as a shear field of time viscosity — eliminating the need for dark matter and extending General Relativity to explain real-world anomalies.**

## 🚀 Core Premise

General Relativity already encodes **time gradients** — physicists just interpret them as "curved space" instead of a **viscous temporal flow**.

We propose that time behaves like a fluid with:
- **Shear (∇T)**
- **Viscosity (τ-resistance)**
- **Turbulence near massive or accelerated bodies**

This explains gravitational lensing, orbital drift, and the behavior of Lagrange points **without requiring dark matter** or altering Einstein’s equations — only reinterpreting them.

## 🧠 1. Einstein Already Uses ∇T — Just Doesn’t Admit It

Einstein’s field equations:

 G_{μν} = (8πG / c⁴) T_{μν}

In the weak-field limit (Schwarzschild metric), the time component becomes:

g₀₀ = −(1 − 2GM / rc²)


Compare with gravitational time dilation:

g₀₀ = −(1 + 2ΔT / T₀)


So:

ΔT / T₀ = −GM / rc²

This is a **normalized time deviation field**. The metric curvature is directly encoding ∇T — they just call it “curved spacetime.”

## 🔭 2. Lensing Without Dark Matter

In weak gravitational lensing, the convergence field κ is:

ψ = ∫ (2ΔT / c²) dz


Substituting:

κ = ∇²(ΔT / T₀)


### ✅ TFFT Interpretation:

This is exactly what TFFT predicts: the convergence field is simply the **second derivative of the time-shear field.** No dark matter needed — it's just ∇²(ΔT / T₀).

## ⚖️ 3. Why the Classical Lagrangian Model Is Incomplete

The traditional Lagrangian in Newtonian and GR frameworks:

- Assumes conservative, frictionless force fields
- Treats time as a parameter, not a medium
- Fails to account for real-world anomalies like:
  - Orbital drift
  - Tidal heating (e.g., Io)
  - Frame dragging and inertia delays
  - Lagrange point instability

## 🌌 4. How TFFT Explains Lagrange Points

Lagrange points in the classical view are balance points between gravity and centripetal force in a rotating frame.

But:
- L1–L3 are unstable
- L4–L5 are stable “triangular” zones — but only under ideal conditions
- Real systems drift due to non-conservative effects

### 🌀 TFFT View:

- Time is a **viscous fluid**
- Lagrange points are **nodes in the τ-field**, where ∇T ≈ 0
- L1–L3 are **temporal saddle points**
- L4–L5 are **shear-stable vortices** (eddies in the time field)
- Drift occurs because **time viscosity is non-uniform**
